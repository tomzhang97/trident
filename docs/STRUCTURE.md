# TRIDENT Code Structure Plan

This project follows a minimal, modular Python package layout. Each module addresses one
concept from the TRIDENT specification while keeping implementations simple and auditable.

## Package Layout (planned)

```
trident/
├── __init__.py          # Package metadata and convenience exports
├── config.py            # Dataclasses describing configuration inputs
├── facets.py            # Facet representation, parsing, and utilities
├── candidates.py        # Passage candidate dataclasses and helpers
├── calibration.py       # Score → p-value calibration helpers
├── safe_cover.py        # RC-MCFC Safe-Cover implementation with certificates
├── pareto.py            # Pareto-Knapsack mode utilities
├── monitoring.py        # Drift monitors and audit logging helpers
├── retrieval.py         # Simple retriever stubs and dataset adapters
├── pipeline.py          # High-level pipeline orchestrating retrieval → selection
├── evaluation.py        # Evaluation harness for multiple QA datasets
└── cli.py               # Command-line entry point for experiments
```

### Support Modules

* `tests/` will hold lightweight unit tests covering the core algorithms with toy data.
* `examples/` (optional) may provide ready-to-run configurations for the listed datasets.

This structure is intentionally flat so that new collaborators can find functionality fast.
Each module will contain a short module-level docstring summarizing responsibilities.
